# Cherenkov-detector-parameterization
A cylindrical detector geometry for Cherenkov-based detector is built;
Cylinder filled with aerogel/quartz, surface polished(defined reflectivity), one end contains the sensitive detector;
Optical properties handling in GEANT4, Parametrizing values for =optimizing "amplification factor";
Readout digitization(to be added).
